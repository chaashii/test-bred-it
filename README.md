### Question 1

###### Write a java program to sum the number from 1 to specific number(n) by using recursion

> ___Example:___ </br>
> -Input n=1 => Process = 1     => Output = 1 </br>
> -Input n=2 => Process = 1+2 => Output = 3 </br>
> -Input n=3 => Process = 1+2+3 => Output = 6 </br>
> -Input n=4 => Process = 1+2+3+4 => Output = 10 </br>

### Question 2
###### Given the list of number and size of processing(chunk) to sum the number from the list.

###### Please sum the list of number for each chunk process and add in the list as the output

> ___Example:___ </br>
> -Input [1,2,3,4,5] with chunk=2 => [1,2], [3,4], [5] => Output = [3,7,5] </br>
> -Input [1,2,3,4,5] with chunk=3 => [1,2,3], [4,5] => Output = [6,9] </br>
> -Input [1,2,3,4,5] with chunk=4 => [1,2,3,4], [5] => Output = [10,5] </br>


### Question 3

###### Given the 2 dimension array with specific size and element(x,y). 
###### Put virus in specific element(x,y)  and the virus will spread from affected area by increasing 1 element around per day.
 
###### Write a java program to calculate how many days that all elements in array will be affected the virus. *Note:* The element x, y start from top left=1,1

> ___Example:___  </br>
> -Input sizeX=4, sizeY=6, elementX=2, elementY=4 => Output = 4</br>
